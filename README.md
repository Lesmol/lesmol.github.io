# Entertainment District

This is a pending project that will develop into being my personal portfolio.

Right now, the project consists of one page that is named "Entertainment District". This page is meant to show whoever visits the site what I do in my free time, outside of coding.
The other pages that will come will be the landing/home page, about page and projects page. Possibly a blog page as well.

I am currently learning React, so my personal portfolio will develop into a React project instead of just being Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Maybe even a mixture of both, with the blog page being done in React.

To keep it brief, I aim to continously work on my porfolio until the day I declare it is complete and showcase my progress web development.

Thank you for reading.
